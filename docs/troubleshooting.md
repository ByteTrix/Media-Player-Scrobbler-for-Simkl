## üñ•Ô∏è Troubleshooting the Windows Executable (MPS for Simkl.exe)

The Windows installer provides a native executable (`MPS for Simkl.exe`) with tray icon and auto-update. Here are some tips for troubleshooting the EXE version:

### Authentication Issues
- If authentication fails or you get stuck, try closing and reopening **MPS for Simkl.exe** from the Start menu or desktop shortcut. This can reset the authentication flow and prompt you again.
- Make sure only one instance is running (check the system tray for the icon).


### Update or Installation Errors
- If an update fails or you see an installation error, try restarting your computer and running **MPS for Simkl.exe** again from the Start menu or desktop.
- Make sure you have the latest installer from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/kavinthangavel/media-player-scrobbler-for-simkl/releases/latest).
- If the tray icon does not appear after updating, try reinstalling the application.
- Always check the log file for details: `%APPDATA%\kavinthangavel\simkl-mps\simkl_mps.log`
- If you encounter persistent update or install issues, please report them in the [GitHub Discussions or Issues](https://github.com/kavinthangavel/media-player-scrobbler-for-simkl/issues) and mention you are using the EXE version.

### Basic EXE Troubleshooting
- Double-click the desktop or Start menu shortcut to launch the app. If nothing happens, check the Task Manager for any running `MPS for Simkl.exe` or `MPSS.exe` processes and end them before trying again.
- If the tray icon is missing, ensure your Windows system tray is enabled and not hiding the icon.
- If you see errors about missing DLLs, install the latest [Visual C++ Redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170).
- For auto-start issues, check that the shortcut exists in your Startup folder (`shell:startup` in Run dialog).
- If you get repeated errors or crashes, try running the EXE as Administrator (right-click ‚Üí Run as administrator).
- For update problems, you can manually run the updater script: right-click `updater.ps1` in the install directory and select "Run with PowerShell".

### Need More Help?
