# üîß Troubleshooting Guide

This document provides solutions for common issues with MPS for SIMKL and steps to diagnose and resolve problems.

## üö® Common Issues and Solutions

### üîê Authentication Problems

<details>
<summary><b>Authentication fails or token errors</b></summary>

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Unable to authenticate" | Check your internet connection and try again |
| "Invalid PIN code" | Make sure you're entering the exact code shown |
| "Token expired" | Run `simkl-mps init` to get a new access token |
| "Client ID not valid" | If using a custom client ID, verify it in your Simkl developer settings |

**Quick fix command:**
```bash
simkl-mps init --force
```

This resets your authentication completely and starts a fresh authentication flow.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Multiple users/devices</b></summary>

MPS for SIMKL currently supports one Simkl account per installation. To switch accounts:

1. Run `simkl-mps init --force` to reset authentication
2. Complete the new authentication flow with your desired account

For multiple users on the same machine, consider using separate user accounts or custom data directories:
```bash
simkl-mps start --data-dir "/path/to/custom/location"
```
</details>

### üîç Detection Issues

<details>
<summary><b>Media not detected</b></summary>

If your media isn't being detected:

1. **Check window title:** Ensure your media player shows the filename in its window title
2. **File naming:** Use clear filenames with the movie/show title and year when possible
3. **Player support:** Verify your player is in the [supported list](media-players.md)
4. **Window detection:** Some players may hide or modify titles in fullscreen mode

**Debugging steps:**
```bash
# Run with debug logging to see what titles are being detected
simkl-mps tray --debug

# Look for lines containing "Window title detected" or "Parsing title"
```

When playing media, you should see log entries showing the detected window title and parsing attempts.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Wrong movie/show detected</b></summary>

If the wrong title is being matched:

1. **Improve filename:** Include the full title and year in parentheses: `Movie Title (2023).mp4`
2. **Check logs:** Run with `--debug` to see what title was extracted and what Simkl matched it to
3. **Manual handling:** For files that consistently mismatch, consider renaming them

**Advanced solution:**
You can modify the title parsing regex in your configuration:
```ini
# In .simkl_mps.env
SIMKL_TITLE_REGEX=(?i)(.+?)(?:\W\d{4}\W|\W\(\d{4}\)|\W\d{4}$|$)
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>No detection in some media players</b></summary>

Some media players may not expose the necessary information:

1. **Configure advanced tracking:** Set up the player's web interface or IPC connection (see [Media Players](media-players.md))
2. **Alternative view modes:** Some players expose title information in windowed mode but not fullscreen
3. **Window title format:** Check if your player has settings to customize the window title format

**Testing command:**
```bash
# This will show all window titles currently visible
simkl-mps windows
```
</details>

### üìä Tracking Problems

<details>
<summary><b>Media never marked as watched</b></summary>

If media isn't being marked as watched:

1. **Completion threshold:** Verify you've watched enough of the media (default: 80%)
2. **Internet connection:** Check if you're online; offline tracking stores to backlog
3. **Advanced tracking:** Configure your player for position detection (see [Media Players](media-players.md))
4. **Process backlog:** Try `simkl-mps backlog process` to send pending updates

**Check progress tracking:**
```bash
# Run in debug mode to see progress updates
simkl-mps tray --debug

# Look for lines containing "Progress" or "position"
```

You should see periodic updates showing your current position and progress percentage.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Position tracking not working</b></summary>

If position isn't being detected:

1. **Player configuration:** Ensure your player's web interface or IPC is properly set up
2. **Port conflicts:** Check if the default ports are being used by other applications
3. **Firewall issues:** Ensure local connections to player ports aren't being blocked
4. **Player versions:** Some newer player versions may have changed their API

**Test player connections:**
```bash
# For VLC
curl http://localhost:8080/requests/status.xml

# For MPC-HC
curl http://localhost:13579/variables.html

# For MPV on Windows
# (requires special tools to test pipe connections)
```
</details>

### üíª Platform-Specific Issues

## üî¨ Advanced Diagnostics

<details>
<summary><b>Debug logging</b></summary>

Enable verbose logging to diagnose issues:

```bash
# Run with debug logging in terminal mode
simkl-mps tray --log-level DEBUG

# Set persistent debug logging
echo "SIMKL_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG" >> ~/.local/share/kavinthangavel/simkl-mps/.simkl_mps.env
```

Key logging indicators:
- **INFO:** Normal operation events
- **WARNING:** Minor issues that don't prevent functionality
- **ERROR:** Problems that prevent specific operations
- **CRITICAL:** Severe issues that prevent the application from running

Important log sections to check:
1. **Authentication issues:** Look for "auth," "token," or "Simkl API" messages
2. **Detection issues:** Look for "window," "title," or "parsing" messages
3. **Playback issues:** Look for "position," "duration," or "progress" messages
4. **Scrobbling issues:** Look for "marked as watched" or "scrobble" messages
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Network diagnostics</b></summary>

Test connections to SIMKL API and media player interfaces:

```bash
# Test SIMKL API connectivity
curl -I https://api.simkl.com/

# Test VLC web interface (if configured)
curl -I http://localhost:8080/

# Test MPC web interface (if configured)
curl -I http://localhost:13579/

# Check for processes listening on media player ports
# Windows (PowerShell):
netstat -ano | findstr "8080 13579"

# macOS/Linux:
netstat -tuln | grep -E "8080|13579"
```

Network-related issues are often indicated by timeout errors or connection refused messages in the logs.
