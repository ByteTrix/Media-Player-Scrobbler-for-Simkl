## What is MPS for SIMKL?

MPS for SIMKL (Media Player Scrobbler for SIMKL) is an automatic scrobbler for [SIMKL](https://simkl.com) that tracks your media playback across various media players and updates your SIMKL account. The application runs silently in the background, requiring minimal setup and maintenance while ensuring your watch history stays up-to-date.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Automatic Tracking**: Detects when you're watching media and scrobbles it to your SIMKL account
- **Smart Media Detection**: Intelligently identifies movies and shows from filenames
- **Multiple Media Players**: Supports VLC, MPV, MPC-HC, PotPlayer, and more
- **System Tray Interface**: Convenient controls and status information
- **Cross-Platform**: Full support for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Offline Support**: Records your watched media when offline and syncs automatically when connection is restored
- **Position Tracking**: Monitors actual playback position for supported players
- **Auto-Update System**: Stay current with the latest features and improvements (Windows installer)

1. **Detection**: The application monitors active windows to detect media players
2. **Identification**: Media titles are extracted and matched against the SIMKL database
3. **Tracking**: Playback position is monitored through window focus or player APIs
4. **Completion**: When you've watched enough (default: 80%), it's marked as watched
5. **Synchronization**: Your SIMKL profile is updated automatically
