# ðŸ“º Local Watch History Viewer

A new feature in MPS for SIMKL is the **Local Watch History Viewer**. This page allows you to browse, search, and analyze your locally tracked watch historyâ€”including movies, TV shows, and animeâ€”directly in your browser.

## Features

- **Unified History:** View all your watched movies, TV shows, and anime in one place.
- **Powerful Search & Filters:** Search by title, year, or overview. Filter by type (movie, show, anime) and year.
- **Modern UI:** Switch between grid and list views. Responsive, fast, and visually appealing.
- **Statistics Dashboard:** See total watched, breakdown by type, and interactive charts (trends, time-of-day, etc).
- **Pagination:** Easily browse large histories with page navigation.
- **Dark/Light Theme:** Toggle between dark and light modes.
- **Detailed Cards:** Click any item for more info, including file details and episode breakdowns for TV/anime.
- **TV Shows & Anime Support:** Full scrobbling and episode tracking for TV and anime, with special handling for anime metadata.
- **Charts & Analytics:** Visualize your watching trends, media type distribution, and viewing times with interactive charts.
- **HTML/CSS/JS Implementation:** Built with vanilla JavaScript, modern CSS, and HTMLâ€”no frameworks required.

## How to Use

1. Open the `watch-history-viewer` folder in your browser (open `index.html`).
2. Make sure your local `data.js` (exported or generated by the app) is present in the same folder.
3. Browse, search, and analyze your watch history!
4. Use the controls to filter by type (movie, TV, anime), year, or search by title/overview.
5. Click any card for detailed info, including file path, size, and episode list for shows/anime.
6. Use the dashboard to view statistics and trends. Toggle between grid/list and dark/light themes as you prefer.

## TV Shows & Anime Scrobbling

MPS for SIMKL now supports **automatic tracking of TV shows and anime** in addition to movies!

- **TV Shows:** Episodes are detected and scrobbled as you watch them in supported players.
- **Anime:** Anime episodes are also detected and tracked, with special handling for anime-specific metadata.
- **Unified History:** All types (movies, shows, anime) appear in your local and online history.

### How It Works
- The app parses filenames and player info to detect if a file is a movie, TV show, or anime.
- For TV/anime, it extracts season/episode and matches to Simkl's database.
- Progress is tracked and synced just like for movies.

### Notes
- For best results, use clear filenames (e.g. `Show.Name.S01E02.mkv` or `Anime.Title.12.mp4`).
- See the [Media Players Guide](media-players.md) for player-specific setup.
