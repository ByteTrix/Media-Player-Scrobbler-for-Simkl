## ‚ö° Quick Start

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/kavinthangavel/simkl-movie-tracker.git
cd simkl-movie-tracker

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up your Simkl credentials in .env file
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials

# Run the background tracker
python main.py
```

## üöÄ Features

- **Zero Configuration** - Works with most Windows media players out of the box
- **Smart Detection** - Intelligent movie recognition using guessit library
- **Background Operation** - Runs silently in the background without a GUI
- **Progress Tracking** - Monitors viewing progress across sessions
- **Automatic Scrobbling** - Marks movies as watched after 80% completion
- **Offline Support** - Maintains sync backlog when offline
- **Resource Efficient** - Minimal CPU and memory footprint
- **Runtime Detection** - Uses actual movie runtime from Simkl API
- **Multi-Window Monitoring** - Can detect and track movies even in non-active windows
- **Enhanced Position Tracking** - Monitors actual player position for better completion detection
- **Comprehensive Logging** - Detailed playback events for debugging and analysis

## üé• Supported Media Players

The following media players are supported on Windows:

| Media Player | Support Status | Position Detection |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| VLC Media Player | ‚úÖ Fully Supported | ‚úÖ (with web interface) |
| MPC-HC/BE | ‚úÖ Fully Supported | ‚úÖ (with web interface) |
| Windows Media Player | ‚úÖ Fully Supported | ‚ö†Ô∏è Title only |
| MPV Player | ‚úÖ Fully Supported | ‚ö†Ô∏è Title only |
| PotPlayer | ‚úÖ Fully Supported | ‚ö†Ô∏è Title only |
| SMPlayer | ‚úÖ Fully Supported | ‚ö†Ô∏è Title only |
| KMPlayer | ‚úÖ Fully Supported | ‚ö†Ô∏è Title only |
| GOM Player | ‚úÖ Fully Supported | ‚ö†Ô∏è Title only |

The scrobbler monitors the window titles of these players to detect media files currently being played. For VLC and MPC-HC/BE with web interfaces enabled, it can also get precise playback position information.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Guide

### System Requirements

- Windows 7/8/10/11
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Simkl account and API credentials

### Required Dependencies

```txt
requests>=2.25.0
pygetwindow      # For Windows window detection
pywin32>=300     # For Windows API integration
guessit         # For intelligent movie name parsing
python-dotenv   # For configuration
psutil          # For process monitoring
```

### Detailed Installation

1. **Get Simkl API Credentials:**
   - Create a [Simkl](https://simkl.com) account
   - Go to [Settings > Developer](https://simkl.com/settings/dev)
   - Create new client to get your Client ID
   - First run will guide you through access token generation

2. **Configure Environment:**
   ```bash
   # Copy example environment file
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Add your credentials to .env:
   SIMKL_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   SIMKL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   # Run automated test with real media player and API integration
   python test_real_playback.py
   
   # Run the tracker (it will run in the background)
   python main.py
   ```

### Auto-Start Setup

To have the tracker start automatically with Windows:

1. Press `Win+R` and type `shell:startup`
2. Create a shortcut with these properties:
   ```
   Target: python.exe "path\to\main.py"  # Or pythonw.exe to hide console
   Start in: path\to\simkl-movie-tracker
   ```

## üéÆ Usage

The tracker runs silently in the background, automatically detecting and tracking movie playback in supported media players. For testing:

```bash
# Test real playback with media player launch
python test_real_playback.py

# Monitor log file
type simkl_tracker.log

# Check detailed playback events
type simkl_movie_tracker\playback_log.jsonl
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Configuration

Key settings in `media_tracker.py`:
```python
DEFAULT_POLL_INTERVAL = 10  # Player check interval (seconds)
COMPLETION_THRESHOLD = 80   # Mark as watched threshold (percent)
VIDEO_PLAYER_EXECUTABLES = ['vlc.exe', 'mpc-hc64.exe', ...] # Supported players
```

### Player Web Interface Setup (for position tracking)

For enhanced position tracking with VLC and MPC-HC/BE:

**VLC Media Player:**
1. Go to Tools > Preferences
2. Select "All" settings mode (bottom left)
3. Navigate to Interface > Main interfaces
4. Check "Web" option
5. Set a password if desired (optional)
6. Default port is 8080

**MPC-HC/BE:**
1. Go to View > Options > Player > Web Interface
2. Check "Listen on port:" (default 13579)
3. No authentication needed

## üîç How It Works

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Monitor Windows] --> B[Detect Player]
    B --> C[Extract Filename]
    C --> D[Parse with guessit]
    D --> E[Match Movie]
    E --> F[Track Progress]
    F --> G{>80% Complete?}
    G -->|Yes| H[Mark Watched]
    G -->|No| F
```

1. **Window Detection**: Uses Windows API to monitor active and non-active windows for supported media players
2. **Title Extraction**: Parses window title for filename/movie info
3. **Smart Parsing**: Uses guessit library to intelligently extract movie title and year
4. **Movie Matching**: Queries Simkl API to identify the movie
5. **Progress Tracking**: Monitors playback position directly from player (when available) or estimates based on time
6. **Auto-marking**: Updates Simkl when 80% threshold reached
7. **Offline Handling**: Queues failed updates in backlog for future retry

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Movie not detected | Ensure media player shows filename in window title |
| No auto-marking | Check `simkl_tracker.log` for API errors |
| Incorrect movie | Include year in filename: "Movie (2023).mp4" |
| Player not detected | Verify player is in supported list |
| Windows permission error | Run as administrator |
| Movie title parsing failed | Use standard naming: "Movie.Name.2023.mp4" |
| Position tracking not working | Enable web interface in VLC or MPC-HC/BE |

### Logs and Debugging
```bash
# Check main application log
type simkl_tracker.log

# Check detailed playback events
type simkl_movie_tracker\playback_log.jsonl

# Run test with detailed output
python test_real_playback.py
```
